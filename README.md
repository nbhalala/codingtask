We'd like you to write a simple URL shortener microservice, similar to [tinyurl.com](http://tinyurl.com) or [bit.ly](bit.ly). When running your service, we should be able to make a request to "/shorten" with a URL of our choice; this should return us a unique URL on the service domain. Visiting this URL should redirect us to our original link.
